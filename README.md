Silver-Bullet-Encryption-Tool
=============================
The only bullet that survives the hardship

Silver Bullet Encryption Tool is an uncrackable encryption Tool based on one-time pad model.

It contains true random number generator which makes data corruptions intentionally with several threads to make true randomness.

Here is a simple description about how it works

1. It encrypts each byte using the random numbers generated by propellant.py script

Ex.) X + Y =10

2. Then, it encrypts the key with a stream of pseudo-random numbers seeded by the passphrase. Even if an attacker managed to get the key (the value of X * Z), there is no way to guess the value of Z because the value of Y is truly random. Simply Random Number times Predictable Number is still random.

Y * Z

3. Now, there is a cipher text, key, and passphrase. It is uncrackable because a possible attacker should know the passphrase to crack it but there is no way to guess it because of the random buffer.


In summary,

X + Y =10

Y * Z = 7

Even if I say the value of Z is 7, there is o way to guess the value of X because of the unpredictable nature of the value Y.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
There was an error in the explanation of how it works in ver. 3.0, and did not protect the passphrase properly.


Hope you enjoy it



---------------------------------------
P.S.

In this programme, I created true randomness using a deterministic system. It was possible using imprecisions. I personally believe this is why the universe expands faster and faster, and entropy of the universe increases.

The universe is made up of 12 fundamental particles interacting in 4 different ways. However, if there is nothing limiting those movements, there can be imprecisions (like the data corruption generated by threads in propellant.py script). This is what makes more and more information, and this is why the universe expands faster and faster. Simply, if there are more entropy (or information), the amount of imprecisions generated by existing information will increase.

If this is the case, the universe is neither infinite or finite. It can be considered both. It is finite because there is definitely boundary of the entire universe, but at the same time, the boundary is being always pushed further and further infinitely.

Again, hope you enjoy this tool and my theory. If you are good at mathematics, please prove this theory.
