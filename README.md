Silver-Bullet-Encryption-Tool
=============================
The only bullet that survives the hardship

Silver Bullet Encryption Tool is an uncrackable encryption Tool based on one-time pad model.

It contains true random number generator which makes data corruptions intentionally with several threads to make true randomness.

From ver. 2.0, Silver Bullet Encryption Tool started to use three dimensional encryption scheme. It means there is a key (or pad) and another passphrase. It is still uncrackable even if a possible attacker managed to obtain the cipher text and key because truly random keys work as buffer, which means there is no way to guess the passphrase and break the code.

It works like this. Each byte is encrypted using this algorithm (a is plaintext, b is the pad, c is psedu-random number generated with a seed from the passphrase, and the number 10 is just an example result)

A+B-C=10

Suppose a possible attacker gained the value of the communicated key (B-C), and encrypted byte (10). If he does not know the pseudo random number (C), still anything is possible for the plaintext.

This means if he/she know 10 and the value of B-C, he/she has no way to know the value of A.

Hope you enjoy it



---------------------------------------
P.S.

In this programme, I created true randomness using a deterministic system. It was possible using imprecisions. I personally believe this is why the universe expands faster and faster, and entropy of the universe increases.

The universe is made up of 12 fundamental particles interacting in 4 different ways. However, if there is nothing limiting those movements, there can be imprecisions (like the data corruption generated by threads in propellant.py script). This is what makes more and more information, and this is why the universe expands faster and faster. Simply, if there are more entropy (or information), the amount of imprecisions generated by existing information will increase.

If this is the case, the universe is neither infinite or finite. It can be considered both. It is finite because there is definitely boundary of the entire universe, but at the same time, the boundary is being always pushed further and further infinitely.

Again, hope you enjoy this tool and my theory. If you are good at mathematics, please prove this theory.
